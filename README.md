This repository hosts a Next.js app that provides a chatbot UI for my AI project. It demonstrates a clean, accessible chat interface wired to a chatbot backend (or API) via the frontend.

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# or
yarn install

yarn dev
# or
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser.

The page is served by `src/app/page.tsx` and will hot-reload as you edit.

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling. See `src/app/globals.css` for base styles.
